# useful-sublime-snippets
I finally learned how to create Sublime Text Snippets, so I'm putting some useful ones on here.


Snippet are bits of code that are activated by a `Tab Trigger` followed by hitting the Tab key.

To have these snippets available to you in Sublime Text, save the snippet in your `/Packages/User` folder.

(They must have the .sublime-snippet extension)

On Windows it is located at: 
`%APPDATA%\Sublime Text 3`
By default.

On macOS it is located at:
`~/Library/Application Support/Sublime Text 3/Packages/User`
By default.
